# c01-accessibility-refactor
Accessibility refactor for Horizon

## Description

This webpage is the first homework assignment for the NW Bootcamp I'm currently attending. The intent is to show the importance of alt text for images and to reduce the redundencies in the code provided. I learned how to write alt text for images that are being referenced exclusively from a .css file, and reinforced other topics we've learned so far.
